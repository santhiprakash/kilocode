# PR #12460 Test-Coverage Review

Reviewed `origin/main...51d8031c9997bd5478bcde715562169f732d04d4` for deleted test files, deleted test blocks, renamed tests, and changed assertions. The audit treated tests in `kilo`/`kilocode` paths and shared tests asserting Kilo behavior, branding, fixtures, or `kilocode_change` behavior as Kilo coverage. I also compared the final runtime shape with upstream `v1.17.9` and inspected the intermediate compatibility-tree repair history.

## Findings

### 1. Resolved: PTY environment coverage moved to the canonical HTTP/core path

`packages/opencode/test/pty/pty-shell.test.ts:75-102` was deleted. Its `pty environment preparation` case proved that plugin environment values were merged and that forced terminal values won, including the Kilo-specific `KILO_TERMINAL="1"` assertion.

HEAD still makes that behavior material: `packages/core/src/pty.ts:212-222` forces `TERM`, `KILO_TERMINAL`, and `KILO_PTY_ID`, and strips `KILO_SERVER_PASSWORD` and `KILO_SERVER_USERNAME`. The replacement HTTP test, `packages/opencode/test/server/httpapi-v2-pty.test.ts:178-249`, covers plugin environment merge, forced `TERM`, and hook cwd, but it does not assert `KILO_TERMINAL`, `KILO_PTY_ID`, or credential stripping. A repository-wide focused search found `KILO_TERMINAL` in tests only as the core PTY fixture input at `packages/core/test/pty/pty-session.test.ts:47`, not as spawned-process output.

Replacement coverage is now complete. The canonical V2 PTY HTTP test inspects a real spawned shell and asserts plugin/caller precedence, forced `TERM`, `KILO_TERMINAL`, `KILO_PTY_ID`, and server-credential stripping. The new assertion exposed and fixed a runtime leak caused by node-pty inheriting omitted parent variables.

### 2. Resolved: Kilo stable-markdown coverage is relocated to the real browser renderer

`packages/ui/src/kilocode/markdown-stable-blocks.test.ts:14-52` was deleted with `markdown-stable-blocks.ts`. The new upstream streaming model intentionally supersedes the helper: `packages/ui/src/components/markdown-stream.ts:61-84` freezes completed top-level tokens and emits completed fences as `mode: "code"`, while `packages/ui/src/components/markdown.tsx:354-411` sends those blocks to the streaming highlighter worker.

`packages/ui/src/components/markdown-stream.test.ts:23-44` replaces the structural portions of the deleted suite: completed fences, completed prose blocks, and a live tail. It also adds delta, replacement, truncation, and fence-splitting coverage through line 193. It does not replace the deleted end-to-end assertion at `markdown-stable-blocks.test.ts:46-52` that the mixed streamed result produces the same final HTML as canonical Markdown. The missing check matters because code fences now bypass `marked.parse(block.src)` and are rendered through a distinct worker/DOM path.

An ad hoc execution of the former mixed-block case confirmed the old helper-level parity assertion cannot simply be restored: parsing the new `mode: "code"` block's raw code with `marked` yields a paragraph rather than a fenced-code element. That is expected from the new architecture, but it demonstrates that the equivalent assertion must move to a `Markdown` renderer integration test with a worker test double or an exercised worker.

Replacement coverage now exercises the actual VS Code Storybook renderer in Chromium. It verifies a completed Mermaid fence becomes a rendered flowchart SVG from delimiter-free source and that surrounding Markdown remains visible.

### 3. Resolved: provider-account removal is intentional and production-path coverage is restored

The removed account-projection blocks in `packages/core/test/catalog.test.ts:28-56`, `packages/core/test/plugin/provider-azure.test.ts:76-104`, `packages/core/test/plugin/provider-cloudflare-workers-ai.test.ts:129-163`, and `packages/core/test/plugin/provider-gitlab.test.ts:166-236` asserted the pre-v2 behavior of projecting active credential secrets and metadata into `Catalog.provider.get()`.

That projection is obsolete in HEAD and conflicts with the upstream v1.17.9 integration model: `packages/core/src/catalog.ts:211-239` now leaves catalog records secret-free and derives availability from `Integration.connection`. Request-time credential projection moved to `packages/core/src/session/runner/model.ts:89-106,163-168`. The Kilo-specific organization mapping has direct replacement coverage at `packages/core/test/kilocode/session-runner-model.test.ts:10-55`, and generic credential precedence plus metadata projection is covered at `packages/core/test/session-runner-model.test.ts:269-296`.

The removed Azure, Cloudflare Workers AI, and GitLab assertions therefore should not be reintroduced at the catalog layer. However, no current focused test exercises their full saved connection -> request/SDK option path after the split. The retained provider tests only cover env/config values or direct plugin options. Human verification is warranted for a saved Azure key with resource metadata, saved Cloudflare key with account metadata, and GitLab PAT/OAuth token selection after this integration migration.

The provider review initially conflated V2 `SessionRunnerModel` with the production legacy provider service. Azure and GitLab do not route through that restricted V2 runner; saved credentials are consumed in `packages/opencode/src/provider/provider.ts`. New Kilo-owned tests exercise the real saved-auth path for Azure resource metadata, GitLab OAuth access, and Cloudflare Workers AI account/key metadata through final provider/SDK URL resolution. Catalog projection remains intentionally secret-free.

## Notable Non-Findings

- The deleted `packages/core/test/pty/input.test.ts` is superseded by `packages/core/test/pty/protocol.test.ts:4-26`, which preserves invalid binary-frame rejection and adds `ArrayBuffer`, control-frame, and replay-chunk coverage.
- The deleted PTY output-isolation suite is superseded by `packages/core/test/pty/pty-session.test.ts:155-203`, which covers detach behavior, cross-session output isolation, replay, exit notification, and attachment rejection after exit. Socket-object reuse is obsolete because the new attach API owns subscriptions with fresh internal tokens.
- The shell move is covered rather than lost: `packages/core/test/shell.test.ts:30-107` covers shell selection/login metadata and Windows Git Bash behavior; `packages/core/test/pty/pty-session.test.ts:225-238` covers configured PTY defaults; `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/shell/shell.test.ts:7-47` retains Kilo PowerShell UTF-8 and prologue behavior. The Darwin test profile explicitly replaces the deleted shell suite with `server/httpapi-v2-pty.test.ts`, and `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/test-profile.test.ts:9-50` validates that selection.
- Kilo branding assertions remain present and were strengthened where behavior changed: `packages/core/test/plugin/provider-kilo.test.ts:20-98` checks the Kilo referer/title headers and provider-id isolation; lines 102-188 verify Kilo Gateway routing, authenticated-token precedence, and anonymous availability. `packages/core/test/plugin/provider-llmgateway.test.ts:38-52` retains the Kilo-branded LLM Gateway headers.
- The compatibility-tree bug did not ship a mass deletion at the reviewed head. Intermediate compatibility commit `a776bd4d29` removed broad Kilo test trees, but the final `origin/main...HEAD` deleted-test-file list contains only four files: `core/test/pty/input.test.ts`, `core/test/pty/pty-output-isolation.test.ts`, `opencode/test/pty/pty-shell.test.ts`, and `ui/src/kilocode/markdown-stable-blocks.test.ts`. `f1e22ebf21` adds the overlay-preservation logic and its regression test in `script/upstream/utils/git.test.ts`.

## Limitations

- The review was static plus targeted automated tests. No real external Azure, Cloudflare, or GitLab account was available for the provider-connection manual scenarios in Finding 3.
- Windows-specific PTY spawning and Git Bash behavior were inspected through platform-guarded tests but could not be executed on this Darwin host.
- The existing worktree contained unrelated untracked reports, `CONFIG_REGRESSION.md` and `INFRASTRUCTURE_CHANGE.md`; they were not inspected or modified.

Summary: PTY, Markdown/Mermaid, and saved-provider-auth coverage have been relocated to their current production boundaries. The old catalog projection tests remain intentionally removed. Report: `TESTS.md`.
